Page loads --> Intro component and button gets shown
On Button click --> 
  - Screen change to show Quiz page
  - API fetches questions with answers; questions go into prev empty questions array
  - questions get rendered as components to screen with 4 randomly shown answers 
    (think up logic so they only get shuffled once) 
    ^ shuffle has to happen only once as effect on questions dependency?
  - button stays the same, but changes text
  - answers change style on click and toggle custom isLogged property
  
On additional Button click --> 
  - button changes text to 'Restart game'
  - state changes to showAnswers --> different styling for answers 
    - isLogged && correctAnswer --> 
    - isLogged && wrongAnswer -->
    - remaining answers 2 types correct and wrong
